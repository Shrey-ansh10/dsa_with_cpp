// LC-865 : Smallest Subtree with all the Deepest Nodes
// Given the root of a binary tree, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.
// Return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree.

// Same Question with different Question Statement
// LC-1123: Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves 
// Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.
// Recall that:
// The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
// The depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.
// The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
     int val;
     TreeNode *left;
     TreeNode *right;
     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};


// Solution Approach: Inspired from lowest common ancestor approach
// Do Post order Traversal -- keep tracking depth as you go down
// Each node returns {depth, root of subtree containing all depest nodes}
// At each Node we have following options:
// -> Left subtree has deeper nodes => return left's ans
// -> right subtree has deeper nodes => return right's ans
// -> Both subtrees have same level of depth => return depth and this root | i.e. {left.first, root}
